# Circular-Object-Recognition

Welcome to Circular Object Recognition, a MATLAB-based image processing project focused on detecting and recognizing circular shapes from images or live video input. Whether it is identifying coins, traffic signs, bottle caps or circular markers in robotics, this tool is built to help.

🎯 Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to accurately detect circular objects from visual input using image processing techniques in MATLAB. It aims to filter out non-circular shapes, enhance image clarity, and deliver reliable detection in real-time or from static images.

🧠 Key Features
🔍 Automatic Circle Detection

🎥 Supports Static Images

🌈 Image Enhancement to improve accuracy in blurred or low-quality visuals

🚫 Non-Circular Shape Filtering to avoid false detections

🛠️ Customizable Parameters like radius range, sensitivity and edge detection thresholds

🖼️ Visual Output with bounding circles and measurement annotations

🧰 Tools & Technologies
